### 📂 [`geometry/`](https://github.com/jeisteve999/Pyton-learning-process/tree/main/python/geometry)
A small modular program to calculate area and perimeter for circles and squares.

- [`circle.py`](https://github.com/jeisteve999/Pyton-learning-process/blob/main/python/geometry/circle.py): Functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle.
- [`square.py`](https://github.com/jeisteve999/Pyton-learning-process/blob/main/python/geometry/square.py): Functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a square.
- [`main.py`](https://github.com/jeisteve999/Pyton-learning-process/blob/main/python/geometry/main.py): Imports the functions and prints the results using dictionaries.
